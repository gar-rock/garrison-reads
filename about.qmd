Garrison-Reads is a blog that I started to keep account of the books that I have read and/or listened to. 
I often find myself seeking to remember various aspects of a previously read books, and needed something to catalog my thoughts and conculsions.
Additionally, you will find a list of interesting vocabulary present in each entry.

Reach out to me if you'd like to discuss any of my reviews!
